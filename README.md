# react-qewd: React/Redux client module for [QEWD](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qewd)

Interface module for writing [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) applications with [qewd (QEWD)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qewd) back-end. Exposes the [ewd-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ewd-client) as object, in React context and as property for use in your React components. 

[QEWD](http://qewdjs.com/) is a unique web framework allowing you to concentrate on your application code, without worrying about system infrastructure, featuring:
- a WebSockets server, allowing your application to connect via this `vue-qewd` module using [ewd-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ewd-client)
- a (federating) REST server, to build your REST endpoints & allowing you to federate requests to other (chained) QEWD servers, featuring [Express](https://expressjs.com/) or [Koa](http://koajs.com/) as underlying frameworks
- a microservices server, using very efficient (permanent, secured) WebSocket connections to other QEWD servers using [JWT](https://jwt.io/)'s
- a [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) server to write & process your GraphQL queries & mutations
- an application router to orchestrate all your different application endpoint(s)/handler(s)
- a master/worker multi-process queue architecture, high-performance and very scalable
- session management/cache allowing you to write stateful applications
- response customization: combine responses from different servers, return responses in different formats, intercept an re-route requests, ...
- database independence: use the [InterSystems CachÃ© unified multi-model database](https://www.intersystems.com/products/cache/), [Redis](https://redis.io/), [GT/M](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/), ... or whatever (No)SQL database technology you like!

Thanks to [Rob Tweed](https://github.com/robtweed) for providing the [qewd-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qewd-react) module this interface module code is based on.

## Installing

    npm install react-qewd

## Use

With [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) components and/or [Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux) and [Redux Thunk middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk), you can start from this example in your source code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { QEWD, QEWDProvider } from 'react-qewd';
...
let qewd = QEWD({
  application: 'qewd-test-app', // application name
  log: true,
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  ajax: function(params, done, fail) {
   	...
  },
});

// we instantiate this object to pass the EWD 3 client to the Redux action methods in actions/*.js
let extraThunkArgument = { qewd };

/*
  instantiate the Redux store with thunk middleware, this allows to dispatch actions asynchronously
  devToolsExtension is needed to enable Redux DevTools for debugging in the browser
*/
const store = createStore(reducers, compose(applyMiddleware(thunk.withExtraArgument(extraThunkArgument)), window.devToolsExtension ? window.devToolsExtension() : f => f));

// main QEWD React container component (similar to the Top component in the qewd-react loader)
function ProviderContainer(props) {
  let styles = {
    MainDiv: { padding: 20 },
    Spinner: { width: '100%', height: 100 },
  };

  /*
    instantiate the Redux Provider with its store as property
    before the connection to the QEWD server is registered, a waiting Spinner is shown
    once the connection is registered, React renders our <App>
  */
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <div style={styles.MainDiv}>
        {
          props.qewdProviderState.registered ?
            <App qewd={qewd} />
          :
            <div style={styles.Spinner}>
              <Spinner />
            </div>
        }
      </div>
    </Provider>
  )
}

/*
  main starting point of your React/Redux application
  instantiates the QEWDProvider component where the qewd client instance is passed in as a property (for use in your components)
*/
render(
  <QEWDProvider qewd={qewd}>
    <ProviderContainer />
  </QEWDProvider>,
  document.getElementById('content')
);

```
